    Performs the bisect search, attempting to find the biggest offenders.  This
    is different from bisect_search() in that this function only tries to
    identify the top k offenders, not all of them.  If k is greater than or equal
    to the total number of offenders, then bisect_biggest() is more expensive
    than bisect_search().

    We do not want to call score_func() very much.  We assume the score_func()
    is is an expensive operation.  We could go throught the list one at a time,
    but that would cause us to potentially call score_func() more than
    necessary.

    Note: The same assumption as bisect_search() is in place.  That is that all
    differing elements are independent.  This means if an element contributes
    to a differing score, then it would contribute to a differing score by
    itself as well.  This is not always true, and this function does not verify
    this assumption.  Instead, it will only return the largest singleton
    offenders.

    @param score_func: a function that takes one argument (to_test) and returns
        a number greater than zero if one of the elements in to_test causes the
        result to be differing.  This value returned is used to compare the
        elements so that the largest k differing elements are found and
        returned.  If all differing elements return the same numerical value,
        then this will be less efficient than bisect_search.
        Note: if the set of elements is not differing, then either return 0 or
        a negative value.
    @param elements: the elements to search over.  Subsets of this list will be

        return positive scores, then only the found offenders will be returned.

    '''
    Performs the bisect search, attempting to find all elements contributing to
    a positive score.  This score_func() function is intended to identify when
    there are "differing" elements by returning a positive score.  This is
    different from bisect_biggest() in that we find all offenders and can
    therefore do some optimization that bisect_biggest() cannot do.

    We do not want to call score_func() very much.  We assume the score_func()
    is an expensive operation.  We could go throught the list one at a time,
    but that would cause us to potentially call score_func() more than
    necessary.

    This function has complexity
      O(k*log(n))*O(score_func)
    where n is the size of the elements and k is the number of differing
    elements to find.

    Note: A key assumption to this algorithm is that all differing elements are
    independent.  That may not always be true, so there are redundant checks
    within the algorithm to verify that this assumption is not vialoated.  If
    the assumption is found to be violated, then an AssertionError is raised.

    @param score_func: a function that takes one argument, the list of elements
        to test if they are differing.  The function then returns a positive
        value if the given list has a differing element.  If the given list
        does not have a differing element, this can return zero or a negative
        value.  Note: this function must be able to handle empty lists.  An
        empty list should instantly return a non-positive value, as there
        cannot possibly be a differing element passed to it.
        It is expected that this function is memoized because it may be called
        more than once on the same input during the execution of this
        algorithm.
    @param elements: contains differing elements, but potentially non-differing
        elements too
    @param found_callback: a callback function to be called on every found
        differing element.  Will be given two arguments, the element, and the
        score from score_func().
    @param skip_verification: skip the verification assertions for performance
        reasons.  This will run the score_func() two fewer times.

    @return minimal differing list of all elements that cause score_func() to
        return positive values, along with their scores, sorted descending by
        score.
        [(elem, score), ...]

    Here's an example of finding all negative numbers in a list.  Not very
    useful for this particular task, but it is demonstrative of how to use it.
    >>> call_count = 0
    >>> memo = {}
    >>> def score_func(x):
    ...     idx = tuple(sorted(x))
    ...     if idx not in memo:
    ...         global call_count
    ...         call_count += 1
    ...         memo[idx] = -2*min(x) if x else 0
    ...     return memo[idx]
    >>> bisect_search(score_func, [1, 3, 4, 5, -1, 10, 0, -15, 3])
    [(-15, 30), (-1, 2)]

    as a rough performance metric, we want to be sure our call count remains
    low for the score_func() function.  Note, we implemented memoization in
    score_func(), so we are only counting unique calls and not duplicate calls
    to score_func().
    >>> call_count
    10

    Test out the found_callback() functionality.
    >>> s = set()
    >>> bisect_search(score_func, [-1, -2, -3, -4],
    ...               found_callback=lambda x, y: s.add(x))
    [(-4, 8), (-3, 6), (-2, 4), (-1, 2)]
    >>> sorted(s)
    [-4, -3, -2, -1]

    See what happens when it has a pair that only show up together and not
    alone.  Only if -6 and 5 are in the list, then score_func() returns a
    positive value.  The assumption of this algorithm is that differing
    elements are independent, so this should throw an exception.

                            contributors, with their contribution to
                            variability.  If K is close to the total number of
                            total contributing functions, then this is a much
                            slower approach in general than the full algorithm.
                            It is best if K is small.  This value used comes
                            from the custom comparison function you provide for
                            your flit test.

                            possibly less than K) may be found during the
                            search.  This is done to ensure that the symbols

                            identifiable through this approach.

    Runs bisect in parallel under the auto mode.  This is only applicable if
    the --auto-sqlite-run option has been specified in the arguments.

    @return The sum of the return codes of each bisect call

    The results will be put into a file called auto-bisect.csv with the
    following columns:
    - testid:    The id of the row from the tests table in the sqlite db
    - compiler:  Compiler name from the db
    - optl:      Optimization level used, options are '-O0', '-O1', '-O2', and
                 '-O3'
    - switches:  Optimization flags used
    - precision: Precision checked, options are 'f', 'd', and 'e' for float,
                 double and extended respectively.
    - testcase:  FLiT test name run
    - type:      Type of result.  Choices are, 'completed', 'lib', 'src', and
                 'sim'.
        - completed:
                 comma-separated list of completed phases.  All phases are
                 'lib', 'src', and 'sym'.  This row is to help identify where
                 things errored out and failed to continue without parsing the
                 log files.
        - lib:   This row has a library reproducibility finding
        - src:   This row has a source file reproducibility finding
        - sym:   This row has a symbol reproducibility finding
    - name:      The value associated with the type from the type column.  For
                 completed, this has a comma-separated list of completed
                 phases.  For lib, the path to the blamed library.  For src,
                 the path to the blamed source file.  For sym, has the full
                 SymbolTuple() output string format, complete with source file,
                 line number, symbol name (before and after demangling), and
                 the filename where the symbol is located.

    Note: only for Intel compilations as the trouble compiler will the lib
    check actually be performed.  If the lib check is skipped, it will still
    show up in the list of completed steps, since it is considered to be a null
    step.
