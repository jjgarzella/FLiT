These benchmarks give insights into the usefulness of FLiT.  Each benchmark has
its own goals, either to demonstrate how FLiT can be useful, or to give
insights into specific tools and functionalities.

The benchmarks are found in the top-level directory `benchmarks`.

These benchmarks are also part of the installation, and can be copied from
there to exercise FLiT's capabilities.  They are installed in

`$(PREFIX)/share/flit/benchmarks`

Here is a brief summary of each benchmark:

* **Random Benchmark**: A benchmark to test the standard library functionality
  with random number generation.

Please look at the code and comments within each benchmark directory for more
information.
