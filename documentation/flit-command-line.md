FLiT comes with a command-line tool called `flit`.  This command-line tool is
simply a symbolic link to `flit.py`.  In the repository, it is located in
`scripts/flitcli/flit.py`.  When installed, it is installed in
`<PREFIX>/share/flit/scripts/flit.py` with the symbolic link at
`<PREFIX>/bin/flit`.

This command is split up into many subcommands.  Most of it is self documented.
For more information, simply call:

```bash
flit --help
```

Possible subcommands:

* [flit help](#flit-help): Display help for a specific subcommand
* [flit init](#flit-init): Initializes a flit test directory for use
* [flit update](#flit-update): Updates the Makefile based on `flit-config.toml`
* [flit make](#flit-make): Run flit tests locally and add results to the database
* [flit import](#flit-import): Imports test results into an SQLite3 database
* [flit bisect](#flit-bisect): Assign variability blame to files and functions

## flit help

This can display the help documentation for a specific subcommand.  This is
just a convenience subcommand.

```bash
flit help init
```

is identical to

```bash
flit init --help
```

This is the preferred method for getting the latest documentation for the
`flit` command-line tool.  The documentation within the tool is more likely to
be up to date than this markdown description.

## flit init

Initializes a flit test directory for use. It will initialize the directory by
copying the default configuration file into the given directory. The config file
is called `flit-config.toml`.

To see how to modify `flit-config.toml`, see the documentation for [FLiT
Configuration File](flit-configuration-file.md).

There are a few other files copied over:

* `flit-config.toml`: the configuration file
* `custom.mk`: a custom file that is included at the end of Makefile
* `Makefile`: an autogenerated Makefile using `flit-config.toml`
* `main.cpp`: a minimal main function.  No modification necessary, but you may
  if you want.
* `tests/Empty.cpp`: This is a template for how to write tests in this
  framework

If you want to play with the litmus tests in this directory, you can pass the
`--litmus-tests` flag which will copy over the litmus tests into the `tests`
directory for use.

## flit update

Updates the `Makefile` based on `flit-config.toml`. The `Makefile` is
autogenerated and should not be modified manually. If there are things you want
to replace or add, you can use `custom.mk` which is included at the end of the
`Makefile`.  So, you may add rules, add to variables, or override variables.

You do not actually need to call this explicitly since the `Makefile` will
automatically call `flit update` to update itself if `flit-config.toml` has
changed.  You should only call it directly if you want to manually examine the
autogenerated `Makefile`.

## flit make

Run the full set of tests through the autogenerated Makefile.  You could do
this manually, but this does a few things conveniently for you, such as

1. Do the build for the run in parallel, automatically choosing a good parallel
   job number
2. Perform the run, by default with only one job, since in general we cannot
   assume that your tests are reentrant.
3. Import the results into the database.

Again, you can do these things manually and have more control.  But for most
users, this will be the most direct and convenient way to run locally.

## flit import

Imports flit results into the database configured in `flit-config.toml`.  It
can either import a CSV file created from a FLiT test executable (using the
`--output` flag) or it can import another SQLite3 database file created from
another call to `flit import`.

The following is an example of how to do a full run of the FLiT litmus tests
and import them into a database file.

```bash
flit init --directory litmus-test-run --litmus-tests
cd litmus-test-run
rm tests/Empty.cpp
make run -j8
flit import --new-run results/*.csv
```

These commands will populate by default a file called `results.sqlite` within
the created `litmus-test-run` directory.  You are free to examine the results
using the `sqlite3` interactive tool or any other method you have for running
queries on an SQLite3 database.

## flit bisect

When FLiT runs identify compilations that cause some tests to exhibit
variability, one may want to investigate further and understand where the
compiler introduced overly aggressive optimizations.

The `flit bisect` tool is capable of assigning blame to individual source files
and can often go further to assign blame to individual functions within the
blamed source files.  You can run `flit bisect` directly giving it a specific
compilation, precision, and test case, or you can tell it to automatically run
for all differences in a given SQLite3 database.

Here is an example of giving a single test case known to show variability:

```bash
flit init --directory litmus-test-run --litmus-tests
cd litmus-test-run
flit bisect --precision double "gcc -O3 -funsafe-math-optimizations" subnormal
```

And here is an example of giving a full SQLite3 database

```bash
flit init --directory litmus-test-run --litmus-tests
cd litmus-test-run
rm tests/Empty.cpp
make run -j8
flit import --new-run results/*.csv
flit bisect --auto-sqlite-run results.sqlite --parallel 8 --jobs 8
```
