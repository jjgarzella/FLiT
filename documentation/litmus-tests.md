FLiT comes with a large number of _litmus tests_ each that demonstrate some
simple aspect of compiler variability (or lack thereof) due to different
compilations.

These litmus tests can be found in `litmus-tests/tests` in the git repository,
or in `<PREFIX>/share/flit/litmus-tests` in the install.  They can be copied to
your test directory using the `flit init` command-line tool (see [flit
init](flit-command-line.md#flit-init)).

The community is encouraged to contribute back interesting test cases that can
be added to these litmus tests.  Simply create a **Pull Request** on GitHub.
