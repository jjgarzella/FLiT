# Benchmarks

[Top-Level Documentation](../README.md)

These benchmarks give insights into the usefulness of FLiT.  Each benchmark has
its own goals, either to demonstrate how FLiT can be useful, or to give
insights into specific tools and functionalities.

These benchmarks are also part of the installation, and can be copied from
there to exercise FLiT's capabilities.  They are installed in
